## Why Use These Templates?

**Problem:** Most teams implement AI chaotically, without structure or measurement  
**Result:** Lost time, uncertainty, no progress  
**Solution:** Systematic approach with proven tools

**Development principle:** Each template is based on neuroscience research and Neurostiv Framework principles, tested in real projects.

## About the Library

This library contains practical templates and tools for implementing Neurostiv Framework in real workflows. Each template is grounded in neuroscience principles and validated across teams of different scales.

**Usage principle:** Adapt templates to your context, don't copy blindly.

## Quick Start

### For New Teams
1. **Start with [readiness assessment](readiness-assessment.en.md)** ‚Äî understand current team level
2. **Create [role matrix](role-responsibility-matrix.en.md)** ‚Äî define who's responsible for what
3. **Implement [RAG assessment](rag-assessment-card.en.md)** ‚Äî begin measuring AI interaction quality
4. **Launch [weekly retrospectives](weekly-retrospective-guide.en.md)** ‚Äî create continuous improvement cycle

### For Existing Teams
1. **Conduct [retrospective](weekly-retrospective-guide.en.md)** ‚Äî analyze current processes
2. **Set up [latency tracker](decision-latency-tracker.en.md)** ‚Äî start measuring decision speed
3. **Use [emergence mapping](emergence-mapping.en.md)** ‚Äî capture already emerging synergies
4. **Optimize through [NTSR tracker](ntsr-innovation-tracker.en.md)** ‚Äî increase solution innovation

## Usage Principles

### Adapt, Don't Copy
Each template is a starting point. Modify them for:
- Your team's size and structure
- Industry and project specifics
- AI integration maturity level
- Corporate culture

### Measure Systematically
Use templates in combination:
- RAG assessments + NTSR tracker = quality + innovation
- Role matrix + latency tracker = structure + speed
- Emergence mapping + retrospectives = insights + improvements

### Iterate Constantly
- Weekly process adjustments in retrospectives
- Monthly role matrix reviews
- Quarterly team readiness updates

## ‚ö†Ô∏è Common Implementation Mistakes

Learn from others' mistakes to avoid repeating them:

- **Skipping readiness assessment** ‚Äî team resists changes without understanding the purpose
- **Blind template copying** ‚Äî tools not adapted to team and project specifics
- **Lack of regularity** ‚Äî retrospectives conducted "when there's time," measurements taken sporadically  
- **Measuring for measurement's sake** ‚Äî collecting metrics that no one analyzes or uses for decisions
- **Ignoring resistance** ‚Äî attempting to implement all templates at once without gradual team adaptation
