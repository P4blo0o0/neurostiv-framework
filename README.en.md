## 🎯 From Chaos to Navigation

**Stop Guessing. Start Navigating.**

Neurostiv Framework transforms AI implementation chaos into systematic Human-AI collaboration. Built on neuroscience principles: **connectivity**, **plasticity**, and **emergence**.

> **Problem:** Organizations spend millions on AI without measurable ROI  
> **Solution:** Operating system for Human-AI teams  
> **Result:** Measurable competitive advantages
