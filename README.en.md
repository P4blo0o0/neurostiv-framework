## 🎯 What is it?

Neurostiv Framework is an open protocol for designing adaptive human-AI teams, based on the principles of neural network operation: **redundant connectivity** and **functional plasticity**.

> **Problem:** AI assistants are not yet effectively integrated into team collaboration  
> **Solution:** An architectural approach inspired by neuroscience  
> **Goal:** Measurable improvement in adaptability to new tasks
