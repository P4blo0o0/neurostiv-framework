## 1. Introduction

**Neurostiv** is an open protocol for building adaptive human-AI teams, inspired by the principles of neural networks (connectivity, plasticity).  

It serves as the foundation for the next generation of systems capable of evolving alongside the user and the organization, rather than limiting them.

The partnership program aims to bring together researchers, companies, and investors to jointly develop the Neurostiv ecosystem via [GitHub Discussions](https://github.com/designhumanai/neurostiv-framework/discussions).

## 2. Types of Partnership

Neurostiv offers several levels of engagement, adaptable to specific goals and contexts:

- **🧪 Research Partnership** — Collaborative work on concepts, publications, and pilot models. *For universities, R&D centers.*  
- **🛠️ Technology Partnership** — Development of tools, APIs, and libraries based on the protocol. *For technical teams and developers.*  
- **🏭 Industry Partnership** — Integration of Neurostiv into specific sectors (finance, education, healthcare). *For industry leaders.*  
- **💡 Investment Partnership** — Support for the project's long-term development and scaling. *For venture funds and strategic investors.*  

Each format entails different levels of responsibility, intellectual property rights, and participation in project governance.
